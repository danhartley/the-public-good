          Their core pledges define how they want to behave in the world. This includes their relationship to and

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offset">
          <strong>A carbon offset</strong> is a reduction or removal of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse
          gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Offsets are measured in tonnes of carbon
          dioxide-equivalent (CO2e).

          Carbon offsetting is controversial. Our founders will need to demonstrate that the offset operations they
          support would not otherwise happen (additionality), and that any benefits are not reversible (permanence).
          They will also need to set a fair price per tonne of carbon offset.
          <span className={styles.super}>
            <a href="#carbon">+</a>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Project pledges</h4>
        <p>
          The price at which the company sells offsets is determined by the price of carbon credits. That price is
          volatile, varies widely, and is likely to rise steeply. Our founders need to consider these factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on their understanding of the market they initially set the price at $25. They stress test this price
          against their project pledges using a decision matrix.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this stage the founders write project pledges. These are more specific than their core pledges and harder
          to ignore. The founders use them to keep their decisions in line with their values.
        </p>
        <p>Examples of pledges our company founders might use to make a decision.</p>
        <ul className={styles.dashedItemsList}>
          {productPledges.map((pledge,i) => {
            return <li key={i}>{pledge}</li>
          })}
        </ul>
        <h4>The decision matrix</h4>
        <p>
          A decision matrix is a way to decide between several options. Criteria are derived from business requirements
          such as profitability, and from pledges. Options either meet or fail criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          The criteria are reordered from most to least important. Criteria that are met are given a score of 1,
          criteria that are not a score of 0. Weighted scores are calculated using the equation:
        </p>
        <p className={styles.inset}>
          <span>
            <strong>
              Weighted score = (1/Rank <span className={styles.multiply}></span> Score){' '}
              <span className={styles.multiply}></span> 100
            </strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Our founders compare three prices: $25, $50 and $100 per tonne of carbon.</p>
        <p>
          The company must set a price that is profitable, competitive, future proof, and satisfies criteria based on
          its project pledges. The weighted scores favour a price of $50.

          scrutiny.
        </p>
        <h4>The decision</h4>
        <p>
          The founders set a price of $65 per tonne. This is far higher than the majority of their competitors but their
          survey suggests there is a niche market willing to pay more for what they consider a fair price. The high
          price also guarantees carbon removal in addition to carbon offsetting.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Writing pledges and integrating them into the decision making process helped the founders set a value on
          carbon dioxide emissions they think will support a profitable and ethical company.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process of writing requirements and checking them against pledges will continue to help guide their
          decisions, whether selecting offset projects, utility providers, or third party software services.
