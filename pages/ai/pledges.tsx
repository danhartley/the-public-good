        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          The problem with making a pledge is that you're supposed to stick to it, sometimes forever. So it was a relief when my colleague Alja and I at <Links.EL link={{ source: 'https://responsibletech.work/' }}>RTW</Links.EL>, decided to make pledges time sensitive. 
          Principles are rocks which change imperceptibly, if at all, but pledges are like eddies in the surrounding waters, to be navigated until we are clear of immediate danger.
        </p>
        <p>Having a moral window in which to act also shifts emphasis from the doer to the thing being done. Acts are transitory but people, and circumstances, change.</p>
        <p>I've been using ChatGPT a lot this year, and talking and thinking about it more. 
          Does the provenance of an idea or work of art matter, do memories exist (or are they simply re-reruns through the model of the brain), and is AI (or not AI), a distraction we cannot afford? 
        </p>
        <p>At RTW we are launching <Links.EL link={{ source: 'https://responsibletech.work/blog/2023/6/20/announcing-the-responsible-ai-pledge-challenge/' }}>The Responsible AI Pledge Challenge</Links.EL>  because AI affects all of us, and if we act collectively, sharing our problems and solutions, we may find a way to make good use of it.</p>        
        <p>Here are my intial pledges.</p>
        <p>
