          Our argument - I am a contributor to RTW - is that if we act collectively, sharing our concerns and
          aspirations, we have a better chance of putting AI to good use.
        </p>

        <h3>My response</h3>
        <p>
          The problem with making pledges is that you're supposed to stick to them in perpetuity. So it was a relief
          when my colleague Alja and I at RTW realised that pledges, like humans, are sensitive to time. Principles are
          rocks which change imperceptibly, if at all, but pledges are like eddies in the surrounding waters, to be
          navigated until we are clear of immediate danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a moral window in which to act also shifts the emphasis from the doer to the thing being done. Acts are
          transitory but people, and circumstances, change.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been using ChatGPT a lot this year, and talking and thinking about it more. Does the provenance of an
          idea or work of art matter, do memories exist (or are they simply re-reruns through the model of the brain),
          and is AI (or not AI), a distraction we cannot afford? I've also been asking myself what the cost is to use
          AI, to our privacy, to people's rights, and to the environment.
        </p>
        <p>I will return to these questions in later posts, but for now, here are my pledges.</p>
