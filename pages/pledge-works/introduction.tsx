                <h2>Stress-testing good intentions.</h2>

                {/* <h3>The raison d'Ãªtre of Pledge Works</h3> */}

                <p>As collaborators at <Links.EL link={{source:'https://responsibletech.work/'}}>ResponsibleTech.Work</Links.EL>, we look for ways to work more responsibly. Since we are designers and programmers we began by challenging how we develop software.</p>

                <p>We wanted an approach that was easy to explain, simple to execute, that worked with existing philosophies and practices widely used in software development, but that required little or no training, and was platform independent.</p>

                <p>Over six months we came up with an approach to responsible design and development we call <strong>Pledge Works</strong>.</p>

                <p>Rather than avoiding challenging questions, we check that the requirements of each new piece of work match our pledges before acting.</p>

                <h3>The Pledge Works workflow</h3>       

                <figure>
                    {/* <Workflow></Workflow> */}
                    <div class={styles.centred}>
                        <img src="/svg/workflow.svg" alt="Workflow" />
                    </div>
                    <figcaption>
                        <br />
                        <div><em>Figure 1: Overview of the Pledge Works workflow</em></div>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>We created Pledge Works to solve a conundrum we face repeatedly in our work: how to act in accordance with our principles. Principles are general and abstract, work is specific and concrete. We use pledges to bridge this gap.</p>                

                <p>Rather than covering everything in one go, I'll take three key parts of Pledge Works, <em>Writing pledges, Stress testing</em>, and <em>Voting</em>, and look at how they fit with common practices.</p>

                <p>When using this process, I run through steps in order, then jump around.</p>

                <h4>1. Defining the work and its scope</h4>

                <p>We are at a stage in the development of Pledge Works when we want to tell people about it, and receive feedback. As an open source project, we also need to keep down costs. These are our high level requirements:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <ul class={styles.standoutList}>
                        <li>We want to add analytics to our site, and pay nothing, or very little.</li>
                        <li>We want to add a discussion platform to our site, and pay nothing, or very little.</li>
                    </ul>
                </blockquote>         

                <p>Because we'll be handling user data, we need to think carefully about data security and privacy. Since we will be reliant on another organisation's services, we will scrutinise their products and motives as well as our own.</p>
                <p>We know what we want to do, we've defined the scope, and are aware of the ethical risks. We're ready to write pledges.</p>

                <h4><em>2. Writing pledges</em></h4>

                <p>We write pledges that are relevant. The <Links.EL link={{source:"https://responsibletech.work/responsible-pledges/"}}>pledges</Links.EL> Alija wrote when setting up ResponsibleTech.Work are broad and inclusive. They set the tone.</p>

                <p>At this stage we want to write pledges tailored to selecting third-party software that handles user data.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <ul class={styles.standoutList}>
                        <li>We pledge not to undertake new work without first evaluating its cost.</li>
                        <li>We pledge not to sell, exchange or exploit user data.</li>
                        <li>We pledge to consider the risks and consequences of using third party services.</li>
                        <li>We pledge to assess the carbon emissions of third parties.</li>
                    </ul>                    
                </blockquote>
             
                <h4>3. Requirements</h4>

                <p>Requirements are the detailed breakdown of the things we need to know and do. We need to know whether an analytics service provides support, offers self-hosting, and how accurate their data are.</p>

                <p>To compare different solutions, especially those that are likely to challenge our pledges, we set up a decision matrix.</p>

                <h4><em>4. Stress testing</em></h4>
        
                <p>We use a <strong>pledge checklist</strong> for creating or building things, and a <strong>decision matrix</strong> for selecting between products or services - as in this case.</p>

                <p>We find it helpful to turn some of our pledges into <em>ethical</em> requirements that we add to our general requirements. Our criteria have equal standing - we have blurred the distinction between functional and <Links.EL link={{source:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement"}}>non-functional</Links.EL> requirements. </p>

                <figure>
                    <AnalyticsProvider></AnalyticsProvider>
                    <figcaption>
                        <em>Figure 2: Simplified Decision Matrix (see <Links.EL link={{source:'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTGzyoiKqybpBObNoC0Z5Ex6obRb3uFY8AsoEakMF_nZUYZdc5o9jyxwrDdk5ok8Nup9hC8Va-M34HI/pubhtml?gid=137244074&single=true'}}>Analytics Decision Matrix for RTW website</Links.EL>)</em>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>We order our criteria by priority from most to least important and give each an appropriately weighted score.</p>

                <p>The decision matrix and pledge checklist are open documents to which anyone can contribute; the aim is to capture essential requirements, and to flag anything which may cause us to break a pledge.</p>

                <p>If a decision leads to a pledge being broken, we vote on whether to accept it.</p>

                <h5>That sounds like a lot of work!</h5>
                <p>At RTW have written a cascade of pledges starting at the organisational level down through projects such as Pledge Works to individual pieces of work. Pledges catch unwanted behaviour and undesirable actions along the way - as long as we stick to them. They become embedded in our practice. As a consequence we don't create decision matrices or pledge checklists often.</p>
                <p>You don't need to disrupt your existing processes to use Pledge Works tactics. You can add them piecemeal, and slowly, and they will still make an impact.</p>

                <h4><em>5. Voting</em></h4>

                <p>We think putting time aside for voting is worthwhile. If we break a pledge, we want to know why, and agree on whether it is acceptable.</p>

                <p>If we cannot reach a decision, or vote against it, we place it in <em>quarantine</em>. We also do this if we cannot gauge the impact of our decision. This honours one of our key project pledges:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    We pledge not to break a pledge if we are ignorant of the consequences.
                </blockquote>

                <p>What quarantine looks like is up to you. We either label or tag our decision, or card, or place it in a quarantine bucket or list.</p>

                <p>If we are in agreement, we are ready to put our decision into effect.</p>

                <h3>The decision</h3>

                <p>We decided against using <Links.EL link={{source:'https://analytics.google.com/analytics/'}}>Google Analytics</Links.EL> for tracking users because whilst free, it profits from user data, and against <Links.EL link={{source:"https://www.discourse.org/"}}>Discourse</Links.EL> because it is too expensive.</p>

                <p>For the RTW website we selected <Links.EL link={{source:"https://docs.github.com/en/discussions"}}>GitHub Discussions</Links.EL> as the forum for discussion and questions. This forum does not allow for anonymous comments (you have to create an account), and may put off users who feel it is too tech-oriented. However, it is free, well maintained, easy to set up and run, and does not commit us. At this stage we are looking for people or companies interested in adopting or trialling Pledge Works - they are likely to be familiar with GitHub, and already have an account. We will implement GitHub Discussions.</p>

                <p><Links.EL link={{source:"https://plausible.io/"}}>Plausible</Links.EL> is the best candidate for analytics but we'll wait to see if we really need it. We place Plausible in quarantine.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>The version of Pledge Works described here fits with traditional agile software development. From the Pledge Works <Links.EL link={{source:"/pledge-works/inventory"}}>inventory</Links.EL> we used <em>Writing pledges, Stress testing, and Voting</em>.</p>

                <p>We recommend using only the parts of Pledge Works you find helpful. There are no hard and fast naming conventions, or strict rules; Pledge Works is not a prescriptive practice. Start with barebones Pledge Works and adopt more of it as necessary.</p>

                <h3>Why we practice Pledge Works</h3>

                <p>Pledge Works is a tool for collaboration that favours ideas over individuals. We use Pledge Works to give weight to our principles by making pledges that affect our day to day work. Our pledges challenge us to address awkward questions that we might prefer to sideline. As a result, we feel better about our decisions, and put into effect more robust solutions.</p>
