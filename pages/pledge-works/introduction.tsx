                <h2>Stress-testing good intentions.</h2>

                <h3>The raison d'Ãªtre of Pledge Works</h3>

                <p>As collaborators at <Links.EL link={{source:'https://responsibletech.work/'}}>ResponsibleTech.Work</Links.EL>, we look for ways to work more responsibly. We began by challenging how we develop software.</p>

                <p>We wanted an approach that was easy to explain, simple to execute, that worked with existing philosophies and practices widely used in software development, but that required little or no training, and was software independent.</p>

                <p>Over six months we came up with an approach to responsible design and development we call <strong>Pledge Works</strong>.</p>

                <p>Rather than avoiding challenging questions, we look at the requirements of each new piece of work through the lens of principles encoded in pledges, before reaching a decision.</p>

                <h3>Pledge Works in practice</h3>       

                <figure>
                    {/* <Workflow></Workflow> */}
                    <div class={styles.centred}>
                        <img src="/svg/workflow.svg" alt="Workflow" />
                    </div>
                    <figcaption>
                        <br />
                        <div><em>Figure 1: Simplified Pledge Works workflow</em></div>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>We created Pledge Works to solve a conundrum we face repeatedly in our work: how to act in accordance with our principles. Principles are general and abstract, work is specific and concrete.</p>

                <p>Rather than covering the full inventory in one go, I'll use what is at the heart of Pledge Works: <em>Writing pledges, Sticking to pledges, and Voting</em>.</p>

                <p>I use a real example in the hope this will make the process clearer. The actions are ordered for clarity but in practice we jump between them.</p>

                <h4>1. Explaining the project</h4>

                <p>We are at a stage in the development of Pledge Works when we want to tell people about it, and receive feedback. As an open source project, we also need to keep down costs. These are our requests (high level requirements):</p>

                <h4>2. Defining the scope</h4>

                <p>Defining the scope of a project is important in order to focus on pledges that are relevant, and will affect our decisions.</p>

                <p>Because we want to find out more about our users, and interact with them, data security and privacy are key areas of concern. Together with our requests, these define our scope.</p>

                <h4><em>3. Writing pledges</em></h4>

                <p>We start by writing pledges based on the scope of the task at hand.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <ul class={styles.standoutList}>
                        <li>We pledge not to undertake new work without first evaluating its cost.</li>
                        <li>We pledge not to sell, exchange or exploit user data.</li>
                        <li>We pledge to consider the risks and consequences of using third party services.</li>
                        <li>We pledge to assess the carbon emissions of third parties.</li>
                        <li>We pledge to make data about us transparent by default.</li>
                    </ul>                    
                </blockquote>
             
                <h4>4. Listing requirements</h4>

                <p>Requirements are the detailed breakdown of the things we need to know and do. For example, we need to know whether an analytics service provides support, offers self-hosting, and how accurate their data are.</p>

                <p>To compare different solutions, especially those that are likely to challenge our pledges, we set up a decision matrix.</p>

                <h4><em>5. Sticking to pledges</em></h4>
            
                <p>The work we take on is guided by our pledges. As we draw up a list of detailed requirements, we add <em>ethical</em> requirements which are either based on existing pledges or written from scratch. Ethical requirements challenge us to stick to our pledges.</p>

                <p>We use a <strong>pledge checklist</strong> for creating or building things, and a <strong>decision matrix</strong> for selecting them.</p>

                <p>Since we are selecting between competing services, we convert our requirements and pledges into criteria for a decision matrix.</p>

                <figure>
                    <AnalyticsProvider></AnalyticsProvider>
                    <figcaption>
                        <em>Figure 2: Simplified Decision Matrix (see <Links.EL link={{source:'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTGzyoiKqybpBObNoC0Z5Ex6obRb3uFY8AsoEakMF_nZUYZdc5o9jyxwrDdk5ok8Nup9hC8Va-M34HI/pub?gid=137244074&single=true&output=pdf'}}>Analytics Decision Matrix for RTW website</Links.EL>)</em>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>We order our list in terms of priority - from most to least important - and give each one an appropriately weighted score.</p>

                <p>The decision matrix is an open document to which anyone can contribute; the aim is to capture essential requirements, and to flag anything which may cause us to break a pledge.</p>

                <p>If a decision leads to a pledge being broken, we vote on whether to accept it.</p>

                <h5>That sounds like a lot of work!</h5>
                <p>We have written a cascade of pledges starting at the organisational level down through projects such as Pledge Works to individual pieces of work. Pledges catch unwanted behaviour and undesirable actions along the way - as long as we stick to them. They become embedded in our practice. As a consequence we don't create a decision matrix or pledge checklist often.</p>
                <p>You don't need to disrupt your existing processes to use Pledge Works tactics. You can add them piecemeal, and slowly, and they will still make an impact.</p>

                <h4><em>6. Voting</em></h4>

                <p>We think putting time aside for voting is worthwhile. If we break a pledge, we want to know why, and agree on whether it is acceptable. We record our decision so that we can review it later.</p>

                <p>If we cannot reach a decision, or vote against it, we place it in <em>quarantine</em>. We also do this if we cannot gauge the impact of our decision. This honours one of our key, organisational pledges:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    We pledge not to break a pledge if we are ignorant of the consequences.
                </blockquote>

                <p>What quarantine looks like is up to you. We either label or tag our decision, or card, or place it in a quarantine bucket or list.</p>

                <p>If we are in agreement, we are ready to put our decision into effect.</p>

                <h4>7. Making decisions</h4>

                <p>We decided against using <Links.EL link={{source:'https://analytics.google.com/analytics/'}}>Google Analytics</Links.EL> for tracking users because whilst free, it profits from user data, and against <Links.EL link={{source:"https://www.discourse.org/"}}>Discourse</Links.EL> because it is too expensive.</p>

                <p>For the RTW website we selected <Links.EL link={{source:"https://docs.github.com/en/discussions"}}>GitHub Discussions</Links.EL> as the forum for discussion and questions. This forum does not allow for anonymous comments (you have to create an account), and may put off users who feel it is too tech-oriented. However, it is free, well maintained, easy to set up and run, and does not commit us. At this stage we are looking for people or companies interested in adopting or trialling Pledge Works - they are likely to be familiar with GitHub, and already have an account. We will implement GitHub Discussions.</p>

                <p><Links.EL link={{source:"https://plausible.io/"}}>Plausible</Links.EL> is the best candidate for analytics but we will wait to see if we really need it. We place Plausible in quarantine.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>The version of Pledge Works described here fits with traditional agile software development. From the Pledge Works <Links.EL link={{source:"/pledge-works/inventory"}}>inventory</Links.EL> we used <em>Writing pledges, The decision matrix, and Voting</em>.</p>

                <p>We recommend using only the parts of Pledge Works you find helpful. There are no hard and fast naming conventions, or strict rules; Pledge Works is not a prescriptive practice. Start with barebones Pledge Works and adopt more of it as necessary.</p>

                <h3>Why we practice Pledge Works</h3>

                <p>Pledge Works is a tool for collaboration that favours ideas over individuals. We use Pledge Works to give weight to our principles by making pledges that affect our day to day work. Our pledges challenge us to address awkward questions that we might prefer to sideline. As a result, we feel better about our decisions, and put into effect more robust solutions.</p>
