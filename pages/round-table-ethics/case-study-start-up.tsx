                    Once a startup has established its purpose, it is ready to write the pledges that will guide its work.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will use a fictitious company selling carbon offsets to explain this process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our company founders want to make decisions that reflect their values, and earn a living. They believe these goals are complementary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following methods set out in <Links.EL link={{source:"/round-table-ethics/introduction"}}>Pledge Works</Links.EL>, they draw up a foundational list of core pledges which will act as their ethical backstop.
                </p>
                <h3>Core pledges</h3>
                <p>                    
                    What a startup does and what a startup is are not quite the same. As a for-profit company, our founders create a <Links.EL link={{source:"https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/entrepreneurship/startupkit/founders-agreement.pdf"}}>Founders' Agreement</Links.EL> (PDF) which sets out, among other things, how they will run the business, and who owns what.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their core pledges define how they want to behave in the world. This includes their relationship to and responsibility towards future employees, customers, partners, providers of services, and abstract entities such as society and the planet. 
                </p>

                        })
                    }
                </ul>          
                <p>
                    These pledges are general and apply to everything the company does.
                    {/* They are in addition to their strategy for achieving equality and diversity. */}

                <p>
                    The startup plans to provide carbon offset services to small businesses and individuals.

                <blockquote cite='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offset'>
                    <strong>A carbon offset</strong> is a reduction or removal of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Offsets are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e).

                </p>
                Carbon offsetting is controversial. Our founders will need to demonstrate that the offset operations they support would not otherwise happen (additionality), and that any benefits are not reversible (permanence). They will also need to set a fair price per tonne of carbon offset.<span class={styles.super}><a href="#carbon">*</a></span>

                <h4>Project pledges</h4>
                <p>
                    The price at which the company sells offsets is determined by the price of carbon credits. That price is volatile, varies widely, and is likely to rise steeply. Our founders need to consider these factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    {/* Our founders build a basic version of their website to test the market. */}
                    {/* <div>
                    Key to the project is the carbon offset cost per tonne our founders will charge customers<span class={styles.super}><a href="#carbon">*</a></span>.

                    </div> */}
                    Based on their understanding of the market they initially set the price at $25. They decide to stress test this price against their project pledges using a <em>decision matrix</em>.
                </p>
                {/* <h5>Proposal:</h5> */}
                {/* <ul class={styles.standoutList}>

                {/* <h5>Pledges</h5> */}
                <p>At this stage the founders write project pledges. These are more specific than their core pledges and harder to ignore. The founders use them to keep their decisions in line with their values.</p>
                <p>Examples of pledges our company founders might use to help them make a decision.</p>
                <ul class={styles.standoutList}>
                    {
                        productPledges.map(pledge => {
                            return <li>{pledge}</li>
                        })
                    }
                </ul>                
                <h4>The decision matrix</h4>                
                <p>
                    A decision matrix is a way to decide between several options. Criteria are derived from business requirements such as profitability, and from pledges. Options either meet or fail criteria.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    The criteria are reordered from most (1) to least important (10). Criteria that are met are given a score of 1, criteria that are not, a score of 0. Weighted scores are automatically calculated using the equation:
                    <div class={styles.inset}>
                        <span><strong>Weighted score = (1/Rank <span class={styles.multiply}></span> Score) <span class={styles.multiply}></span> 100</strong></span>
                    </div>                    
                </p>
                <p>Our founders decide to compare three prices: $25, $50 and $100 per tonne of carbon.</p>                
                <p>
                    The company must set a price which is profitable, competitive, future proof, and satisfies criteria based on its project pledges. The weighted scores favour a price of $50.
                    {/* These prices are just a guide, so the founders could compromise on a price between $35 and $40. */}
                </p>

                        <em>Figure 2: Simplified Decision Matrix (see <Links.EL link={{source:'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTGzyoiKqybpBObNoC0Z5Ex6obRb3uFY8AsoEakMF_nZUYZdc5o9jyxwrDdk5ok8Nup9hC8Va-M34HI/pubhtml?gid=1748215232&single=true'}}>Carbon price per tonne</Links.EL>)</em>

                <p>
                    Since the outcome of the decision matrix is unclear, and a recent Reuters <Links.EL link={{source:"https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/carbon-needs-cost-least-100tonne-now-reach-net-zero-by-2050-2021-10-25/"}}>poll of climate economists</Links.EL>  puts the mean value of offsetting a tonne of carbon at $100 if we are to reach net zero by 2050, the founders commission a marketing survey of their target audience.

                    They publish their thinking, including the decision matrix, in line with their pledge to expose their methods to scrutiny.
                    {/* They also hope this may balance the confirmation bias startup founders are subject to. */}
                </p>
                <h4>The decision</h4>
                <p>
                    The founders set a price of $65 per tonne. This is far higher than the majority of their competitors but their survey suggests a niche market willing to pay more for what they consider a fair price.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Writing pledges and integrating them into the decision making process helped the founders set a value on carbon dioxide emissions they hope will support a profitable and ethical company.</p>
                <p>The process of writing requirements and checking them against pledges will continue to help guide their decisions, whether selecting offset projects, utility providers, or third party software services.</p>
