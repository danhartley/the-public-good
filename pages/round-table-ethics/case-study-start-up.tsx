                <h2>
                    Once a startup has established its purpose, it is ready to write the pledges that will guide its work.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will use a fictitious company selling carbon offsets to explain this process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our company founders want to make decisions that reflect their values, and earn a living. They believe these needs are complementary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the methods set out in Round Table Ethics, they draw up a foundational list of core, organisational pledges which will act as their ethical backstop.
                </p>
                <h3>Core pledges</h3>
                <p>                    
                    What a startup does and what a startup is may appear synonymous but there are differences. As a for-profit company, our founders create a <Links.EL link={{source:"https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/entrepreneurship/startupkit/founders-agreement.pdf"}}>Founders' Agreement</Links.EL> (PDF) which sets out, among other things, how they will run the business, and who owns what.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their core pledges define how they want to behave in the world. This includes their relationship to and responsibility towards future employees, customers, partners, providers of services, and abstract entities such as society and the planet. 
                </p>
                <ul class={styles.bulletList}>
                    {
                        corePledges.map(pledge => {
                            return <li>{pledge}</li>
                        })
                    }
                </ul>          
                <p>
                    These pledges are general and apply to everything the company does. They are in addition to their strategy for achieving equality and diversity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As others join, they will introduce pledges specific to their profession or job. Role-based pledges are used by individuals and teams to guide their own work and to highlight issues, and risks, not previously considered. It is worth taking time to make sure role-based pledges align with core pledges.
                </p>
                <h4>Role-based pledges</h4>

                        })
                    }
                </ul>
                <h4>The purpose of the company</h4>
                <p>
                    The startup plans to provide carbon offset services to small businesses and individuals.

                    <strong>A carbon offset</strong> is a reduction or removal of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Offsets are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e).

                </p>
                But offsetting is <Links.EL link={{source:"https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-why-co2-removal-is-not-equal-and-opposite-to-reducing-emissions"}}>controversial</Links.EL>. The founders will need to demonstrate that the offset operations they support would not otherwise happen (additionality), and that any benefits are irreversible (permanence).

                <h4>Project pledges</h4>
                <p>
                    Our founders build a basic version of their website to test the market.
                    <div>
                    Key to their project is the carbon offset cost per tonne<span class={styles.super}><a href="#carbon">*</a></span> they will charge their customers. They know the value their competitors typically use but are sceptical - they think an artificially low figure is being used so as not to put people off.
                    </div>
                </p>
                <h5>Proposal:</h5>
                <ul class={styles.bulletList}>
                    {
                        projectProposals.map(pledge => {
                            return <li>{pledge}</li>
                        })
                    }
                </ul>
                <p>They stress test the offset cost per tonne against their project pledges using a <em>decision matrix</em>. Relevant project pledges throw a spotlight on the concrete proposal.</p>
                <h5>Pledges:</h5>

                <h4>The decision matrix</h4>                
                <p>
                    A <span class={styles.reset}><Links.EL link={{source:"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WY--FcQeEikLxqWtvKdY_MYcd1Ukzvi0eN2Ufl_YHaY/edit#gid=1748215232"}}>decision matrix</Links.EL></span> is a way to decide between several options. Criteria are derived from business requirements such as profitability, and from pledges. Options either meet or fail criteria.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    The criteria are reordered from most (1) to least important (10). Criteria that are met are given a score of 1, criteria that are not, a score of 0. Weighted scores are automatically calculated using the equation:
                    <div class={styles.inset}>
                        <span><strong>Score = (1/Importance * Met)*100</strong></span>
                    </div>                    
                </p>
                <p>The options our founders must decide between are prices of $25, $50 and $100 per tonne of carbon.</p>
                <p>
                    The price at which the company sells offsets is determined by the price of carbon credits. That price is volatile, varies widely, and is likely to rise steeply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The company must set a price which is profitable, competitive, future proof, and satisfies criteria based on its project pledges. The weighted scores favour a price of $50. These prices are just a guide, so the founders could compromise on a price between $35 and $40.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <CostPerTonne></CostPerTonne>
                    <figcaption>
                        <em>Figure 2: Simplified Decision Matrix (see <Links.EL link={{source:'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WY--FcQeEikLxqWtvKdY_MYcd1Ukzvi0eN2Ufl_YHaY/edit#gid=1748215232'}}>Carbon price per tonne</Links.EL>)</em>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    But since the outcome of the decision matrix is unclear, and a recent Reuters <Links.EL link={{source:"https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/carbon-needs-cost-least-100tonne-now-reach-net-zero-by-2050-2021-10-25/"}}>poll of climate economists</Links.EL>  puts the mean value of offsetting a tonne of carbon at $100 if we are to reach net zero by 2050, the founders commissioned a marketing survey of their target audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They publish their thinking, including the decision matrix, in line with their pledge to expose their methods to scrutiny. They also hope this may balance the confirmation bias startup founders are subject to.
                </p>
                <h4>The decision</h4>
                <p>
                    The founders set a price of $65 per tonne. This is far higher than the majority of their competitors but their survey suggests a niche market willing to pay more for what they consider a fair price.
                </p>
                <figure>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Writing pledges and integrating them into the decision making process helped the founders set a value on carbon dioxide emissions they hope will support a profitable and ethical company.</p>
                <p>The process of writing requirements and checking them against pledges will be repeated often, whether selecting offset projects, utility providers, or third party software services.</p>
