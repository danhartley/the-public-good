              The Mediterranean region is warming 20% faster than the world as a whole, raising concerns about the
              impacts that climate change and other environmental upheaval will have on ecosystems, agriculture and the
              region’s 542 million people.
            </div>
            <div>
              Heat waves, drought, extreme weather and sea-level rise are among the impacts that the region can expect
              to see continue through the end of the century, and failing to stop emissions of carbon dioxide and other
              greenhouse gases could make these issues worse.
            </div>
            <div>
              Charting a course that both mitigates climate change and bolsters adaptation to its effects is further
              complicated by the Mediterranean’s mix of countries, cultures and socioeconomics, leading to wide gaps in
              vulnerability in the region.
            </div>
          </blockquote>

          <ul>
            <li>
              In the parts of the Mediterranean that rely on rain-fed crops, the more concentrated and intense winter
              rainfalls anticipated by climate forecasts are likely to leech soils of key nutrients.
            </li>
            <li>
              Soil biodiversity, which includes everything from invisible microbes to insects and earthworms, is waning
              in the Mediterranean and could be pushing a critical food-producing region toward utter collapse.
            </li>
            <li>
              The loss of soil moisture could lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of drought. With less water evaporation
              as temperatures continue to bake the soil, there’s less rain to replenish that moisture, leading in turn
              to more drought.
            </li>
            <li>
              One way to adapt would be the introduction of drought-adapted crop varieties. That transition has already
              begun in parts of France’s wine industry.
            </li>
            <li>
              Irrigation may provide stopgap relief by bringing enough water to coax a few more harvests from drier
              soil. But the longer-term impacts could lead to a broader drawdown of the region’s water resources, and to
              a buildup of salt in soils — an effect that wrecked ancient Mesopotamian civilizations.

          <h3>Mediterranean climate</h3>

          <p>
            The Mediterranean has a subtropical climate with hot summers and mild winters. Precipitation is concentrated
            in the winter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The subtropics fall outside of the tropics of Cancer (in the northern hemisphere) and Capricorn (southern
            hemisphere).
          </p>
          <p>The tropics mark the most northerly and southerly (subsolar) points.</p>
          <p>
            The Tropic of Cancer (or the Northern Tropic) is the circle of latitude that contains the subsolar point at
            the June (or northern) solstice when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tropic of Capricorn (or the Southern Tropic) is the circle of latitude that contains the subsolar point
            at the December (or southern) solstice when the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum
            extent.
          </p>
          <p>On the June solstice the Tropic of Cancer receives more sunlight than anywhere else on earth.</p>
          <p>On the December solstice the Tropic of Capricorn receives more sunlight than anywhere else on earth.</p>
          <p>
            Mediterranean climate has a Köppen climate classification of Csa/Csb (Temperate/Semi-arid/Hot summer or Warm
            summer).

          <h3>Unimagined</h3>
          <p>
            My thoughts break in two directions - towards despondency (that my archetypal landscape is artificial, a
            consequence of millenia of human disruption) - and towards hope (that this counterfeit is a savage-benign
            successor to the original).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is perfect and imperfect, a human place, made by us for us; an example of what is best for us and a
            reflection of what is best in us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to turn things around; not congratulate ourselves for small sacrifices. Instead we must describe how
            we should behave, and to reveal every step backwards for the failure that it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not like to say must; but we must. We must be clear-eyed in our observations and we must be
            categorical in our demands (both those we make of ourselves and those we make of others).

          <div>Jacques Blondel | Abstract</div>
          Factors to take into account:
          <ul>
            <li>
              One cannot understand the components and dynamics of current biodiversity in the Mediterranean without
              taking into account the history of human-induced changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The various systems of land use and resource management that provided a framework for the blossoming of
              Mediterranean civilizations also had profound consequences on the distribution and dynamics of species,
              communities, and landscapes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The processes of domestication of plant and animal species, which first occurred in the eastern
              Mediterranean area some 10,000 years ago, contributed to the increase of certain components of
              biodiversity at several spatial scales. Positive and negative feedback cycles between cultural practices
              and natural systems at the local and regional levels have kept ecosystems robust and resilient.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assuming that human action can, to a certain extent, be considered a large-scale surrogate for natural
              sources of ecosystem disturbance, such patterns give support to the diversity-disturbance
              hypothesis—specifically, intermediate levels of disturbance have promoted biological diversity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Intraspecific adaptive variation increased as a result of human-induced habitat changes over millennia,
              resulting in bursts of differentiation during the later Holocene of local ecotypes and gene pools of
              domesticated and wild plant and animal species, with region-specific characters fitting them to local
              climate and environmental conditions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is concluded that a high degree of resilience of Mediterranean ecosystems resulted in a dynamic
            coexistence of human and natural living systems, which in some cases provided stability, while fostering
            diversity and productivity.

              The negative effects were mainly evident in stressed environments due to the dry summers and the lowest

          <blockquote>
            <div>
              Traditionally, olive trees have been grown in the region surrounding the Mediterranean, mainly as a
              rainfed crop with low productivity given the typical dry environment of this region.
            </div>
            <div>
              In recent years, the expansion of olive oil and table olive production has been achieved through both an
              increase in the planted area and through intensification within and beyond the Mediterranean countries by
              increasing the orchards’ density and via the introduction of irrigation.
            </div>
            <div>
              In the last two decades, HD and SHD orchards, known as hedgerow olive orchards, have been developed to
              further reduce harvesting costs using over-the-row harvesting machines.
            </div>
            <div>
              Current water scarcity in traditional olive-growing regions, like Alentejo, along with the expected
              increase in heat waves and droughts caused by climate change [16,19,20], imply an urgent need to reduce
              the use of water for irrigation of crops in these regions and to adopt measures to avoid the degradation
              of soil resources and biodiversity.

          <h5>The Olive Orchard Mosaic</h5>
          Traditional Olive Orchards (TD)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Management of cover crops is conducted by tillage or total herbicide coverage. Grain crops were
              traditionally grown within olives as primary sources of farmers' income. Soil erosion can be dramatic and
              temperature of the soil's top layer is high in the summer (over 40 °C). Although olive is a well-adapted
              species to drought conditions, the soil's exposure to direct sun and the lack of canopy shade over the
              tree root zone leads to water and heat stress, and can induce summer dormancy in the trees.
            </li>
            <li>
              Farmers use few fertilizers and apply a reduced number of chemical pest and disease treatments in the
              olive groves. They are pruned every four years by chainsaw, and the pruning residue is generally burned.
              The alternate bearing is very strong, with a sparse yield in the year following pruning. Since these
              orchards are rainfed, the biodiversity of species is sometimes low due to the lack of water and cover
              crops.
            </li>
            <li>
              Traditionally, the harvest is performed by hand with wood sticks, although nowadays, some growers use
              portable backpack shakers with or without nets covering the floor.
            </li>

              They are rainfed or little irrigated, and the soil is kept weed-free by tillage or by partial (in the
              rows) or total herbicide application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many have spontaneous cover plants, mainly in the interrows, which are used to some extent as grazing
              lands. In this case, animal manure provides some nutrient recycling for the ecosystem and complements the
              annual fertilization.
            </li>
            <li>
              The pruning is carried out in alternate years and is less intense than in the traditional orchards. The
              pruning residue is often burned.
            </li>
            <li>
              The sun exposure of the soil is lower due to the improved tree shade, resulting in better development of
              resident herbaceous vegetation that increases insect populations, improving biodiversity, and provides
              more protection against soil erosion than in the TD systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              The harvest is carried out by tree shaking using floor nets or wraps around the trees as collecting
              systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              These orchards have been upgraded over time by increasing plant density and providing better irrigation.
              This agricultural system is undergoing a fast transition to a higher-density system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Net production of these olive ecosystems is 3-6t ha<span class={styles.super}>-1</span> of fruits
            </li>
          </ul>
          The High- (HD) and Super-High-Density (SHD) Olive Orchards
          <ul>
            <li>The success of the higher-density olive agricultural systems is based on water availability.</li>
            <li>
              The olive tree is an evergreen species with a remarkable water control process that manages water losses,
              requiring less water in the summer than in the remaining period of the year.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nevertheless, in a region with 562 mm year<span class={styles.super}>-1</span> of average rainfall [44],
              250 mm to 500 mm year<span class={styles.super}>-1</span> of supplemental irrigation water are the
              necessary values for the trees to achieve their maximum productivity.
            </li>
            <li>
              This demand is lower when compared to the 500–800 mm year<span class={styles.super}>-1</span> required by
              other perennial species. Under these conditions, higher densities lead to increased productivity.
            </li>
            <li>
              For soil management, the soil is normally covered with spontaneous or sowed herbaceous vegetation to
              minimize soil erosion. The sowed cover species could be <strong>Fabaceae</strong> sp., like{' '}
              <strong>Medicago sativa</strong>, <strong>Vicia</strong> sp. or <strong>Trifolium</strong> spp., which are
              quite important nitrogen recyclers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spontaneous or sowed cover crops are also important refuges for beneficial insects or pollinators, which
              improve the general biodiversity of HD and SHD orchards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inter-row weed management is usually carried out by shredding 3 to 5 times a year to keep the weeds below
              0.5 m in height. The shredding also recycles the pruning residues left in the topsoil of these orchards.
            </li>
            <li>
              One advantage of HD and SHD olive orchards is the soil temperature. In the same location, the temperature
              of the topsoil in the summer, measured with a FLIR (Forward Looking InfraRed) device, was about 20 °C
              lower at the top of the cover grass when compared to bare topsoil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Harvests in HD and SHD olive orchards require tractor trunk shakers with wraps around the tree collectors
              or over-the-row self-propelled machines. The latter can harvest up to one hectare per 1 h (12–22 t of
              fruits). As the fruits are never in contact with the ground, they are quite suitable for virgin or
              extra-virgin oil production.
            </li>
            <li>
              In Portugal, the harvest is restricted to the period from sunrise to sunset in order to prevent
              involuntary bird losses, since these animals often use olive trees as refuges overnight.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Water Management</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Crop water requirements (CWR) are defined as the amounts of water needed to replace the water lost through
              evapotranspiration by a disease-free crop growing in large fields under no limitations regarding soil
              conditions, including soil water and fertility, and achieving full production potential in the given
              growing environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the case of irrigated crops, the concept of irrigation water requirement (IWR) must be considered. The
              IWR is the amount of water that is required to be applied to a crop to fully satisfy its specific crop
              water requirement whenever rainfall, soil water storage, and groundwater contributions are insufficient.
            </li>
            <li>
              Olive trees' water requirements are a function of cultivar characteristics, management, and environmental
              demands. Olive trees withstand long periods of drought and can survive in very sparse plantings, even in
              climates with very low annual rainfall: values of 150–200-250mm year<span class={styles.super}>-1</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, for economic production, much higher precipitation or irrigation are required: an average annual
              precipitation or irrigation 600-950mm year<span class={styles.super}>-1</span>, in soils with good
              water-holding capacity, is needed for successful cultivation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Water needs throughout the year (budding, flowering) and at different points in the life cycle (young,
              old) of the tree.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vegetative development, yield, and fruit quality are affected by water availability and controlled by
              irrigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              In Sustained Deficit Irrigation (SDI), the irrigation water used at any moment during the season is below
              the crop evapotranspiration demand. This is based on the idea of allotting the water deficit uniformly
              over the entire growing season. Thereby, the water deficit increases progressively as the season advances
              due to a combination of the uniform application of a reduced amount of water and the depletion of
              available soil water. This allows water stress to develop slowly and for the plants to adapt to the water
              deficits when the soil presents significant water storage capacity.

            <li>
              Times when water needs of the tree must be met
              <ul>
                <li>
                  From the last stages of floral development to full bloom, normally in mid-April, when water stress can
                  affect flower fertilization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At the end of the first stage of fruit development, normally in June, when water stress causes
                  reductions in fruit size.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the midsummer period, normally from late August to mid-September, when a marked increase in oil

          <h5>Agroecological Practices</h5>
          Non-Tillage, Cover Crops and Herbicide Reduction
          <ul>
            <li>
              Semi-arid Mediterranean regions are among the most productive areas in the world [118]. However, the soil
              has a low carbon content and is susceptible to degradation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tillage increases CO2 emission at the expense of organic matter, contributing to global climate change.
            </li>
            <li>
              In irrigated olive orchards such as HD or SHD, it is possible for non-tillage practices to be implemented.
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-tillage system avoids the propagation of soil-borne diseases such as{' '}
              <strong>Verticillium dahliae</strong>, the main soil-borne disease for this perennial species worldwide.
              Preventing soil disturbance and minimizing the contact of fungus mycelia from root to root decreases the
              infection rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Herbaceous vegetation can have a positive impact on erosion reduction, especially in orchards planted on
              slopes, contributing to carbon and nitrogen sequestration and acting as a nutrient buffer.
            </li>
            <li> Herbaceous cover also provides shelter and food for many beneficial and pollinator insects.</li>
            <li>
              Vectors for the bacteria <strong>Xylella fastidiosa</strong> could also live and feed on orchard weeds.
            </li>
            <li>
              The generalized application of herbicides dramatically decreases the number of species, plants, animals,
              and other living organisms present in an olive orchard ecosystem. For instance, the abundance and
              diversity of nematodes is lower in bare soils treated with herbicides, and is intermediate in
              non-herbicide areas. Normally, tillage reduces the number of arthropod species.
            </li>
            <li>
              The use of herbicides in the total area of an orchard increases the rainwater runoff and contributes to
              faster soil erosion and lower nutrient availability. The use of herbicides sprayed in stripes, as in rows
              of trees, seems to have a lower impact on soil erosion.
            </li>
            <li>
              {' '}
              Weed species present on an olive orchard’s floor, like <strong>Conyza</strong> sp., present significant
              challenges nowadays, as they are not effectively controlled by glyphosate spray treatment. The eventual
              withdrawal of this herbicide will lead to the implementation of other non-herbicide solutions for orchard
              floor management.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Pruning Biomass Recycling
          <ul>
            <li>
              In HD and SHD olive orchards, the pruning wood is normally shredded together with the cover weeds, and its
              nutrients are slowly released over time. This is a way to recycle nutrients and organic matter. The
              presence of chopped wood pieces and weed residues on the orchard floor has four main benefits.
              <ul>
                <li>Decreases the rainwater runoff speed and helps to prevent erosion.</li>
                <li>
                  Promotes the rainwater infiltration rate, which is quite important in the case of heavy rain events.
                </li>
                <li>Improves machines’ traction, preventing tractor or harvesters’ wheels from sliding.</li>
                <li>
                  Crossed chopped wood pieces act as a physical barrier over the floor, preventing soil compaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  High tree density has an impact on biodiversity e.g. bird population reduction. Heavier machinery and
                  increased fertilizer, pesticide, and water usage are also said to negatively impact ecosystems’
                  biodiversity. The generalized adoption of drip irrigation increases the{' '}
                  <strong>Verticillium dahliae</strong> in the soil. The inoculum density in all experiments was higher
                  in wet than in dry areas, and after 4 months of watering, the soil pathogen population increased
                  considerably in both wet and dry areas. The inoculum density remained higher in the wet soil.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Conclusion
          <ul>
            <li>
              The increase in tree densities, the introduction of irrigation, and the development of new training
              systems to facilitate mechanical pruning and harvesting have contributed significantly to the
              intensification and expansion of olive oil and table olive production. In recent years, concerns about the
              potential detrimental impacts of high-density olive cultivation have emerged, bringing into question the
              trade-offs between production benefits and environmental costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Water-saving irrigation practices and more sustainable soil management or other agroecological practices
              can mitigate the negative effects of climate change and improve the ecosystem services of dense irrigated
              olive cultivation.
            </li>
          </ul>

              The Mediterranean Basin is the cradle of civilisation and has thus been heavily influenced by man over the
              last 6,000 years or so.
            </div>
            <div>
              Devoid of man’s intervention the Mediterranean Basin would typically be a climax of evergreen
              sclerophyllous forest dominated by evergreen oaks or pines. Below this dominant tree layer would be found
              a mixed evergreen sclerophyllous shrub layer and below this a perennial herbaceous layer.

            <div>
              Around the Mediterranean due to man’s interactions this primaeval climax community is now fairly rare and

              The dominant evergreen forest in the Western Mediterranean is Holm Oak (Quercus ilex), which grows on all
              the Mediterranean soils and occasionally forms dense forests, but is more commonly seen in scattered
              groups now.

              {' '}
              In the Eastern Mediterranean the Kermes Oak (Quercus coccifera) replaces the Holm Oak, but there it does
              not form forests except in Crete and the rest of the Peloponnese.
            </div>
            <div>
              These forests are rarely seen in their climax state: dense dark woodlands up to 15 metres high, with an
              understory shrub layer of:

              Typically, in their climax state there is little light reaching the ground if these forests are dense, and
              so there is no herb layer, but they are sparse now and it is more usual to see scattered trees with a

              Cork Oak (<strong>Quercus suber</strong>) forests can be found in the Central and Western Mediterranean,
              as well as Portugal, but only on siliceous soils in warmer and maritime zones. The Cork Oak forests have
              been carefully managed by man for decades and so are typically more open occasionally with a Maquis layer
              beneath.

              The Aleppo Pine (<strong>Pinus halepensis</strong>) forests are dominant in the hotter and drier
              Mediterranean zones, forming climax vegetation on limestone and littoral soils. It’s drought tolerance is
              remarkable and it can be found at altitudes of 1,000 metres above sea level. These forests are however
              open rather than dense, again with Maquais vegetation beneath.

            <div>
              There is a climax of cultivated and wild Olive, (<strong>Olea europea subsp. europea var. europea</strong>{' '}
              and <strong>Olea europea subsp. europea var. sylvestris</strong> respectively), and numerous feral forms
              plus Carob (<strong>Ceratonia siliqua</strong>) in hot and arid zones and the Aleppo Pine is fond

            <div>
              The Maritime Pine (<strong>Pinus pinaster</strong>) forms pure stands only in maritime locations on
              siliceous outcrops and these can be seen in Spain, France and Italy especially.
            </div>
            <div>
              The Umbrella or Stone Pine (<strong>Pinus pinea</strong>) have a wider distribution on sandy littoral
              dunes, and typically these have a luxurious undergrowth.

              Cypress (<strong>Cupressus sempervirens</strong>) occur as scattered tress with evergreen undergrowth and
              some Garrigue species, notably on: Crete, Rhodes and Cyprus.

            <h5>The Maquis Biome</h5>
            <div>
              Two distinct and major Maquis variations have been determined by ecologists. One is referred to as PRIMARY
              Maquis and the other is referred to as SECONDARY Maquis. It is not possible to know if the Maquis is the
              highest expression of vegetative development, or whether it is a climax developing under certain
              conditions intrinsic to the Mediterranean. The Primary Maquis is probably the highest form, but because of
              the long intervention of man in the Mediterranean, in most cases the Maquis is a Secondary Maquis, that is
              the result of felling the primaeval evergreen forests.

              Humans constantly cut down the vegetation and cultivate the ground for pasture or/and orchards and
              vineyards, only to abandon these at some later time. This has been a cyclic operation, (review again the
              model presented earlier in the discussion,) and consequently the Maquis has numerous variations which defy
              complete organisational categorisation.

              <strong>High Maquis</strong>: Tall shrubby formations to 4 or 5 metres in height of the meso- and
              thermo-Mediterranean zones of the Mediterranean basin. Generally the High Maquis has a more or less closed
              canopy with a dominant stratum of: Tree Heather (Erica arborea), Strawberry Tree (Arbutus unedo), Greek
              Strawberry Tree (Arbutus andrachne), Holm Oak (Quercus ilex), Kermes Oak (Quercus coccifera), Olive (Olea

              <strong>Low Maquis</strong>: Very shrubby formations usually between 1.5 and 2 metres in height, with a
              distinct lack of tall tree species. This formation has associations of, Wig Tree (Phillyrea media), Mastic
              Tree or Lentisk (Pistacia lentiscus), Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), Jerusalem Sage (Phlomis
              fruticosa), Butcher’s Broom (Ruscus aculeatus), Jerusalem Thorn (Paliurus spina-christi), Sage-leaved
              Rock-rose (Cistus salviaefolius), Montpellier Cistus (Cistus monspielensis), Hairy Rockrose (Cistus

              <strong>Cistus Maquis</strong>: is a variant of the Low Maquis, widespread in hot arid zones, Montpellier
              Cistus (Cistus monspielensis) is often dominant in the Western Mediterranean, while Hairy Rockrose (Cistus

              In the Mediterranean landscape the wild olive, (Olea europea spp europaea var. sylvestris) is now
              naturally found in the sclerophyllous and heathland shrubby biome called the: Maquis (French), Macchia
              (Italian), Chaparral (Portuguese) Matorral (Spanish), Phrygana (Greek), Garig (Croatian), Batha (Hebrew).
              Feral forms of the domesticated Olive are here also. Feral forms of olive arise from cultivar crosses and

            <h5>Wildfires in the Maquis</h5>

            <div>
              Thanks to its lignotuber the olives can recover from some of these types of wildfires and all that scrubby
              congested inner weedy branch structure which wild untended olives possess is removed – this is natural
              pruning.
            </div>
            <div>
              The olive tree (wild and domesticated) typically has around 82% leaf moisture during the dry season and
              around 86% during the wet seasons, and that is not much of a variance illustrating its immense water
              retention capacity. This becomes clearer when you compare it to other non-sclerophyllous Mediterranean
              species like, Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) which has 58% leaf moisture in the dry season and 114% in the
              wet season.
            </div>
            <div>
              In furnace trials at 750° C the ignition delay of olive leaves was between: 2.77 and 4.36 seconds during
              the dry season, and between: 4.07 and 6.43 seconds in the wet season. If we compare that to the Hawthorn
              (Crataegus monogyna) which had an ignition delay of between: 2.62 – 1.98 seconds in the dry season, and
              between: 2.18 and 3.63 seconds in the wet season we can see that the resistance of the olive leaf to fire
              is high.
            </div>
            <div>
              Of the 45 Mediterranean species in the trial the Hawthorn was ranked at position 4 (wet and dry season)
              making it very fire susceptible, while the olive was at position 25 (dry season) and 33 (wet season),
              placing it in the middle and top division of the study. The full report PDF entitled: ‘Mediterranean
              Forest Ecosystems, Wildland Fires, Cypress and Fire-Resistant Forests’ by: Tuncay Neyisci of the Akdeniz

              Throwing in a general note of interest on the Maquis, as well as <strong>lignotubers</strong> many species
              produce seeds which generally require stratification by fire to break seed dormancy, for example the
              Spanish Broom (Spartium junceum), which not only requires fire to stratify the seeds, the seed pods
              actually explode with heat and projects the seeds outwards in all directions – seed dispersal by fire.

              The term steppe designates a mosaic of open, low plant formations composed of xerophytic, herbaceous and
              ligneous vegetation, often in scattered clumps and devoid of trees.
            </div>
            <div>May often represent the final stage of landscape degeneration caused by humans (disputed).</div>
            <div>
              Natural steppe is found where rainfall is too low to support a forest, but high enough to not create a
              desert. Mediterranean steppe varies tremendously according to rainfall from north and south, and from east
              and west. It is often found on interior plateaus and mountain ranges where natural vegetation has been
              cleared or/and extensive grazing has removed most of the vegetation.
            </div>
            <div>
              When all the arborescent shrubs which play an important role in building up soils and creating protection
              for herbaceous species have been removed what remains are annuals and the tough herbaceous perennials
              which can survive the hostile droughts of the Mediterranean summers.
            </div>
            <div>
              Grasses, Irises, Poppies and members of Composite family exist on the steppe where low rainfall (100-300mm
              paer annum) and high temperatures (to 40°C).

          <blockquote>
            <div>
              The olive tree has a very effective lignotuber allowing it to regrow after fire and frost and this equals
              continuation via rapid regeneration. In the Mediterranean, forest fires are a normal part of the
              ecosystem, and frosts though rarely harsh, as they are in the cold temperate zones do occur in the
              Mediterranean if infrequently. If the leaves and small aerial parts of the tree are burned off by fire or
              killed by frost, regrowth is rapid because the root system remains intact and full of stored energy and
              vigour to power the regrowth. So, what would kill a tree from another species is merely a form of natural
              pruning to an olive, and in some respects it’s an advantage because olives benefit from quite hard
              pruning.
            </div>
            <div>
              The olive tree and its numerous cultivars are evergreen xerophytic (drought hardy) trees possessing
              hypostomatic leaves covered with trichomes (glandular hairs) on both sides. These epidermal trichomes
              conserve moisture and humidity around the stoma thus allowing them to stay open for prolonged respiration
              and photosynthesis in harsh arid conditions.
            </div>
            <div>
              These evergreen leaves are also sclerophyllous (hard and heat resistant) to further conserve moisture. The
              leaves are ever present meaning photosynthesis can commence at any time when conditions are right. So,
              working together the trichomes and sclerophyllous leaves allow the olive tree to tolerate severe drought
              and harsh solar conditions which would kill other tress.
            </div>
            <div>
              The extended photosynthesis allows for sugars to become more concentrated in the cells and thus the cells
              are more resistant to freezing. This is a common factor with many species from all the Mediterranean zones
              around the world. For example, a -5°C will kill certain Mediterranean species in the UK, but the same
              temperature will not kill that same species in the Mediterranean because the cell sap is denser wither
              sugars, and thus resists freezing.
            </div>
            <div>
              Olive trees are slow growing hardwoods and the olive root system is wide spreading and shallow to exploit
              surface water (i.e., dew) again preventing desiccation and death in an otherwise hostile environment.
            </div>
            <div>
              Once established its secondary thickened root plate is extremely hard like its trunk, the wood of which
              has a crushing strength of 11,180 lbf/in2 (77.1 MPa) and thus it is more difficult for pathogens to
              penetrate. It doesn’t stop pathogens completely, but it certainly does diminish their efficacy.
            </div>
            <div>
              In its native environment soils are poor shallow and stony, thus in conjunction with the arid aerial
              environment leaf systems, the vegetative growth of olive trees are further slowed down and this results in
              even harder denser heartwood. These native soils also have high alkaline pH levels and many pathogenic
              fungi favour moist acidic soil pH, so the pathogens in the natural environment are to some extent
              restricted also by the environment.

              There are two broad mechanisms by which plant populations persist under recurrent disturbances:
              resprouting from surviving tissues, and seedling recruitment. Species can have one of these mechanisms or
              both.

          <h4>Postfire regeneration traits</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Postfire resprouting</strong> The ability to generate new shoots from dormant buds after stems
              have been fully scorched by fire. This term is preferable to sprouting, which refers to initiation of new
              shoots throughout the life cycle of a plant. Species are typically classified as resprouters or
              nonresprouters depending on this ability. There are different types of resprouting depending on the
              location of the buds (epicormic, lignotuber, rhizome, roots, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Postfire seeding</strong> The ability to generate a fire-resistant seed bank with seeds that
              germinate profusely after fires (fire-cued germination). Typically, such species restrict recruitment to a
              single pulse after a fire. Seeds may be stored in the soil or in the canopy (seed bank; Box 3). Species
              are typically classified as seeders or nonseeders (or fire-dependent/fire-independent recruiters)
              depending on this ability. There are different types of postfire seeding.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Postfire strategies</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Obligate resprouter</strong> Plants that rely on resprouting to regenerate after fire (resprouters
              without postfire seeding ability). These plants do not germinate after fire because they lack a
              fire-resistant seed bank. Note that obligate resprouters might reproduce by seeds during the fire-free
              interval, but the terminology of seeders and resprouters refers to the postfire conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Facultative seeders</strong> Plants that have both mechanisms for regenerating after fire, that
              is, they are able to resprout and to germinate after fire.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Obligate seeders</strong> Plants that do not resprout and rely on seeding to regenerate their
              population after fire (nonresprouters with postfire seeding ability). Because they tend to recruit
              massively once in their lifespan (after fire) and fire kills the adults and typically exhausts their seed
              bank, they can be considered semelparous species with nonoverlapping generations and a monopyric life
              cycle. Note that the term ‘seeders’ refers strictly to postfire conditions, and cannot be attributed to
              plants that regenerate by seeds in other conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Postfire colonizers</strong> Plants that lack a mechanism for local postfire persistence, but they
              recruit after fire by seeds dispersed from unburned patches or from populations outside the fire perimeter
              (metapopulation dynamics).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Life cycle in relation to fire</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Monopyric</strong> Species that perform all their life cycle within a fire cycle. In plants,
              examples are annual and biennial species, postfire obligate seeders and some bamboos.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Polypyric</strong> Species that perform all their life cycle through multiple fire cycles. In
              plants, examples are those with postfire resprouting capacity as well as trees with other survival
              strategies such as very thick bark.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Basic fire regimes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Surface fires</strong> Fires that spread in the herbaceous or litter layer, such as the understory
              of some forests and in savannas and grasslands. These fires are usually of relatively low intensity and
              high frequency.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Crown-fires</strong> Fires in woody-dominated ecosystems that affect all vegetation including
              crowns. They are typically of high intensity. Examples are fires in some Mediterranean-type forest and
              shrublands and in closed-cone pine forests.
            </li>

          Decision-making of citizen scientists when recording species observations
        </Links.EL>
        <div>Diana E. Bowler et al. | Scientific Reports</div>

        <blockquote>
          <div>
            Citizen scientists—or volunteers contributing to scientific projects—increasingly take part in biodiversity
            monitoring by reporting species observations. In Europe, for example, 87% of the participants in species
            monitoring are volunteers3. Chandler et al.2 estimated over half of the data in the Global Biodiversity
            Information Facility (GBIF)—the largest global biodiversity database—comes from citizen science platforms.
          </div>
          <div>
            Citizen scientists make many decisions—before, during, and after observing species—that can affect different
            aspects of the data that they collect and report.
          </div>
          <div>The majority of species occurrence data come from unstructured citizen science projects.</div>
          <div>
            Many previous studies to understand the data collection decisions of citizen scientists have taken a
            data-driven approach by analysing the patterns in the available data e.g. spatial patterns of the data, for
            example finding evidence for higher sampling effort near human settlements and roads.
          </div>
          <div>
            An alternative approach to understanding citizen science data is by directly asking citizen scientists about
            their data collection activities.
          </div>

          <h5>Questions</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Experience</strong> Number of years collecting data and frequency of data collection, and, in a
              later section, on membership of natural history societies, formal knowledge of biodiversity monitoring and
              participation in any large-scale structured monitoring schemes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Motivations</strong> Rate the importance of ten different aspects about why they record
              biodiversity on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'not important at all' to 'very important'. Our
              selection of motivation factors was guided by similar ones included in other studies, including both
              intrinsic factors (motivated directly by enjoyment of the activity) and extrinsic factors (motivated for
              reasons outside of enjoyment of the activity itself). For instance, we included ‘have fun exploring’ as an
              intrinsic motivation and ‘support conservation’ as an extrinsic motivation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Survey types</strong> Report what proportion of their species observations come from different
              species survey types: active and planned species surveys (i.e., going to a place with the intention of
              looking for species), opportunistic observations not seen during an active search or observations made
              using traps—on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘none’ to ‘all’.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Active searches</strong> Rate the frequency with which they reported different kinds of species
              (e.g., all observed species or rare species only) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘never’ to ‘very
              often’ during an active and planned search and how long they typically spend looking for species
              (answering in minutes or hours).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Opportunistic observations</strong> Rate the frequency with which different scenarios (e.g.,
              observations of rare species or simultaneous observations of many species) triggered opportunistic
              observations on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘never’ to ‘very often’.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trap use</strong> If participants previously indicated that they used traps, they were asked to
              rate the frequency with which they reported different kinds of species collected in their traps on a
              5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘never’ to ‘very often’ and how long the traps were left active
              (answering in hours or days).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Species ID uncertainty</strong> The frequency with which they dealt with uncertainty about the
              taxonomic identification in different ways (e.g., not report or guess), on a 5-point Likert scale ranging
              from ‘never’ to ‘very often’.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Locations</strong> Rate how often they looked for species in different habitats (e.g., forests,
              grasslands) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘never’ to ‘very often’.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consecutive surveys</strong> Rate how likely they were to report seeing a species again in the
              same place according to different time-periods since the previous detection of the same species, on a
              5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘not at all likely’ to ‘very likely’.

            <div>
              Também em Portugal esta árvore se comporta como uma espécie invasora embora nenhuma medida de erradicação
              tenha sido levada a cabo sobretudo devido ao valor económico da espécie. Contudo, dado que o eucalipto
              consegues absorver grandes quantidades de água no verão, apresenta vantagem competitiva sobre as demais
              espécies vegetais, com consequências nefastas para a biodiversidade das florestas.
            </div>
            <div>
              Outra polémica em torno desta espécie prende-se com os fogos florestais, um flagelo recorrente em Portugal
              na época de verão. E assim, o Governo português começou a estabelecer limites para as de eucalipto no país
              a fim de conter a expansão da espécie e incentivar o plantio de espécies de árvores nativas europeias,
              porém não nativas de Portugal, que também possuem importância económica e cultural quanto a espécie
              invasora possui, mesmo assim a medida se baseou na controversa da plantação de Eucalyptus globulus e das
              outras espécies de eucalipto em Portugal.

              </li>
              <li>
                This oil is not only in the trunk, it is in the leaves and long bark strips which peel off and collect
                on the forest floor or remain suspended on the trees. Essentially, left to its own devices, the
                eucalyptus stands in a pile of its own debris, ready to burn, and so continue its life-cycle (fire opens
                the seed pods).
              </li>
              <li>
                This debris ignites like gasoline drawing the super hot ground flames into the canopy where the fire may
                spread on a second high and fast moving front – crown to crown.
              </li>
              <li>
                With the atmospheric phenomena that occurred on 17 June, a ‘normal’ forest wildfire can turn into a
                terrifying, explosive firestorm in minutes where it attains such intensity that it creates and sustains
                its own wind system, flinging out flaming embers which ignite new fires.
              </li>
              <li>
                The steep eucalyptus and pine clad hillsides of Central Portugal further facilitate fire
                spread…depending on the gradient, the oil-fuelled, wind-driven fires will double or quadruple their
                speed going uphill, also further increasing the heat intensity.
              </li>
              <li>
                In very hot air temperatures, the eucalyptus oil gives off fumes or vapour similar to petrol which can
                explosively ignite, occasionally blowing the burning crown off to travel through the air to start a new
                ignition point miles away. In Australia there are records of secondary outbreaks within 20 km of the
                original fire front.

            <p>Eucalyptus after a wildfire</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Depending on the severity of the fire, the eucalyptus re-sprouts readily post-fire even if the tree is
                destroyed above ground (top-killed). It sends up new shoots from <strong>lignotubers</strong> (woody
                growths at ground level or underground) and/or from epicormic buds on the trunk. These epicormic buds
                are stored deep in the trunk where the bark is thickest.
              </li>
              <li>
                The proportion of pine trees in the eucalyptus stand in a wildfire positively affects mortality and
                top-kill of the eucalyptus.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a managed eucalyptus stands the burned trees are usually cut and the basal re-sprouts may be retained
                for coppicing.
              </li>
              <li>
                The seeds of a eucalyptus are stored in woody capsules in the canopy where they are safer from fire heat
                damage as ground fire temperatures are higher than those at the canopy. If seed capsules are on the
                ground in a fire they will burn like everything else.
              </li>
              <li>
                The heat of a fire triggers the capsule to split (dehiscence), which allows for germination (in its
                original region) in the optimal post-fire conditions and when the risk of new fire is low.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Is the eucalyptus to blame for the 2017 fire tragedy?</p>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            <div>
              The answer has to be no. It is the extraordinary level of neglect and mismanagement of the eucalyptus by
              man that is to blame, allowing the unchecked accumulation of fuel. Man has permitted the unimpeded spread
              of continuous forests and the ‘double jeopardy’ of these forests composed of mixed flammable eucalyptus
              and pine, right to the very edges of our roads, houses and villages.
            </div>
            <div>
              The flammable eucalyptus tree is demonised for many reasons but especially when it comes to wildfires by
              causing them to spread and burn faster. However, there is not one scrap of empirical scientific evidence
              that demonstrates this despite all the articles written to the contrary and repeated so often that
              everyone believes it.
            </div>
            <div>
              It has been demonstrated that any unmanaged forest plantation with a high density of undergrowth,
              brushwood or scrub responds to fire in a similar manner, regardless of the dominant species, compared to
              the fire behaviour of other plantations with intense management of the understorey vegetation. So,
              whenever there is eucalyptus, pines or cork oak stands without understorey management, fires can burn for
              days.
            </div>
            <div>
              Given a ‘choice’ a fire, by far, ‘prefers’ to burn scrubland over forest. In a forest area however, a fire
              will avoid Ceratonia siliqua (Carob tree), evergreen oaks and Pinus pinea (Stone pines) in favour of Pinus
              pinaster (Maritime pine), Eucalyptus globulus and deciduous oaks. Further analysis showed maritime pine
              stands are more fire prone than all other forest types, including eucalyptus.
            </div>
            <div>
              Eucalyptus also gets a lot of stick for using excessive amounts of water, consequently drying out the
              ecosystem and thereby increasing the wildfire risk. Research from Australia has reported the remarkable
              finding that all eucalyptus measured across Australia used the same amount of water for a given amount of
              leaf material – other tree species use various different amounts of water. Estimations of the amount of
              eucalyptus tree cover at a given location using satellite images of the leaves can help calculate how much
              water the entire forest or catchment area uses. Of course controlling eucalyptus water consumption by
              reducing leaf material would require additional forest management measures, the basics of which are
              lacking in most areas of Portugal.

            <p>Maritime pine trees in wildfires</p>

            <div>
              A mature maritime pine can usually survive a low to moderate intensity surface fire because it has thick,
              fissured bark.
            </div>
            <div>
              However, a pine rarely survives when it is in the path or head of an exceptionally hot, intense wildfire
              such as in 2017. Where you see the trunk completely charred from top to bottom, the tree is likely to be
              dead. Young maritime pines nearly always perish in fierce forest fires as they have thinner bark and not
              having reached a mature height, they burn as understorey vegetation. As intense wildfires happen more
              frequently than they did in the past, the pine forests are decreasing in size. In their place there is the
              progressive substitution of eucalyptus in the region.
            </div>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The needles and wood litter of the maritime pine is prone to easy ignition, fast and complete combustion
                and high heat release.
              </li>
              <li>
                The close density of the pines (often mixed with eucalyptus) in unmanaged forests makes for extreme
                amounts of surface fuel that exacerbates the potential for conflagrations. The canopies are also close
                or overlapping which facilitates crown-to-crown ignition.
              </li>
              <li>
                Like the eucalyptus, pines produce their own volatile compounds (such as α-pinene) which are present in
                pine needles. These compounds are released when temperatures reach around 150-175 º C. They accumulate
                locally in the air around the trees and when ignited as the flames reach the area, burn rapidly and
                intensively possibly causing the phenomena of a fire ‘flash-over’ or explosion.
              </li>
              <li>
                Where there are more frequent successive fires in a maritime pine forest area, the trees become even
                more of a fire hazard because the new young pine trees can never reach maturity and act like understorey
                shrubs that greatly increase the probability of fire.
              </li>
              <li>
                Stands of maritime pine commonly grow on the steep hillsides of Central Portugal so the speed and heat
                intensity of the fire increases as it travels uphill and at the crest. This also makes fighting the fire
                very difficult.
              </li>
              <li>
                It must be noted that where stands of pines have been thinned, there will be increased wind movement and
                litter drying which may aggravate a future ground fire.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Maritime pine trees after a fire</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The pine is partially serotinous and seeds stored in cones in the canopy are the major source for the
                post-fire regeneration of the tree.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cone serotiny (closed cones which require heat to open) may vary among individual trees in the same
                population – particularly found in the younger trees.
              </li>
              <li>The serotinous cones of maritime pine begin opening at temperatures around 50º C.</li>
              <li>
                The cones open gradually in the two or three days that follow the thermal shock such that when seed
                dispersion begins the fire is extinct and seeds land on a cool bed of ash.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adult trees are often killed by fire, depending on the degree of crown and cambium damage, and there is
                no re-sprouting in the species.
              </li>
              <li>Typically the burned trees are salvage logged and natural regeneration from seeds occurs.</li>
            </ul>

            <div>
              Where pines have been cut, thinned or pruned, the crown branches with attached needles are frequently left
              on site which significantly increases the risk of future fires – less shade on surface fuels, increased
              wind speeds, reduction of relative humidity, increased fuel temperature and reduced fuel moisture.
              Immediately after the 2017 fires, there was a rush to cut the dead pines before they lost weight and
              became less valuable, and later cutting to comply with the land cleaning deadlines. In many cases the
              owners have left vast piles of pine debris which will not decompose any time soon. It can take more than 7
              years for pine litter to completely decompose – longer, if there are prolonged spells of dry weather which
              slow the action of fungi, bacteria and gastropods etc.
            </div>
            <div>
              In the forests away from human habitation, it may be that the debris is deliberately spread across a cut
              site in order to mitigate the effects of erosion. This is an common method of erosion control after a
              fire. However, some experts believe that due to climate change, ‘mega-fire’ events will become more
              frequent in the near future, essentially becoming the new ‘normal’ wildfire. This then makes extensive
              salvage logging and leaving debris in situ look to be a decidedly dangerous option.
            </div>

          <p>Mitigation</p>

          <div>
            “The best management solutions for the mitigation of forest fires is forest diversification and the use of
            species that create less fuel formations, in particular deciduous hardwoods, such as oak, chestnut or other
            hardwoods, because they have a high content of humidity.
          </div>
          <div>
            These species are not conducive to tree fires and should, therefore, be considered in mixtures with other
            species or in strategic areas for prevent the spread of fires.”

          <blockquote>
            <div>
              Classically, vicariant phenomena have been essentially identified on the basis of biogeographical and
              ecological data. Here, we report unequivocal evidences that demonstrate that a physical–chemical
              characterization of the epicuticular waxes of the surface of plant leaves represents a very powerful
              strategy to get rich insight into vicariant events. We found vicariant similarity between Cercis
              siliquastrum L. (family Fabaceae, subfamily Cercidoideae) and Ceratonia siliqua L. (family Fabaceae,
              subfamily Caesalpinoideae). Both taxa converge in the Mediterranean basin (C. siliquastrum on the north
              and C. siliqua across the south), in similar habitats (sclerophyll communities of maquis) and climatic
              profiles.
            </div>
            <div>
              These species are the current representation of their subfamilies in the Mediterranean basin, where they
              overlap. Because of this biogeographic and ecological similarity, the environmental pattern of both taxa
              was found to be very significant. The physical–chemical analysis performed on the epicuticular waxes of C.
              siliquastrum and C. siliqua leaves provided relevant data that confirm the functional proximity between
              them.
            </div>
            <div>
              A striking resemblance was found in the epicuticular waxes of the abaxial surfaces of C. siliquastrum and
              C. siliqua leaves in terms of the dominant chemical compounds (1-triacontanol (C30) and 1-octacosanol
              (C28), respectively), morphology (intricate network of randomly organized nanometer-thick and
              micrometer-long plates), wettability (superhydrophobic character, with water contact angle values of
              167.5±0.5° and 162±3°, respectively), and optical properties (in both species the light
              reflectance/absorptance of the abaxial surface is significantly higher/lower than that of the adaxial
              surface, but the overall trend in reflectance is qualitatively similar). These results enable us to
              include for the first time C. siliqua in the vicariant process exhibited by C. canadensis L., C.
              griffithii L., and C. siliquastrum.

            <div>
              Ecosystems are formed by the interactions between a community of living organisms and the physical
              environment that surrounds them. These ecosystems undergo ecological succession in response to changes in
              environmental conditions; this is a natural process of change over time that is brought about by
              progressive replacement of one plant or animal community with another.
            </div>
            <div>
              This process starts with what is called as the “pioneer community”, and eventually leads to the
              development of a stable and mature community, referred to as the “climax community”. The process of
              succession can halt at a pre-climax stage when some factor is limiting; such as when the organism needed
              to bring about the necessary changes that lead to the creation of the following community is absent. Apart
              from biotic factors (living), limiting factors may also be abiotic (non-living), such as lack of water.

            </div>
            <div>
              Steppe is considered as the first stage in the ecological succession process. It is derived from maquis
              and garrigue as a result of some form of degradation, such as that caused by fire or animal grazing. It is
              widespread, and is characterised by herbaceous plants, especially grasses.

              This habitat is generally devoid of shrubs, and is mainly comprised of annuals, that is, plants that live
              up to one year. During the dry season, this habitat type appears dry and impoverished because most plant
              species will, at the time, exist in the form of seeds. In contrast, the wet season brings about a change
              in this habitat type, which results in steppe being entirely covered by a large variety of herbaceous
              plants.
            </div>
            <div>
              One also finds other types of steppe locally, including some natural ones. These are formed through
              climatic factors, and include the rocky steppe and the clay slope steppe.

              <strong>Garrigue</strong>
            </div>
            <div>
              The second stage in ecological succession is garrigue. It is characterised by limestone rocky ground with
              a rugged surface, known as <strong>karst</strong>, and is heavily exposed to the brute force of the
              elements. Garrigue is typified by low-lying, usually aromatic and spiny woody shrubs that are resistant to
              drought and exposure. This type of habitat appears desolate, and is often referred to as wasteland.
              Nevertheless, it is probably the most species-diverse habitat in the Maltese Islands, and is of great
              importance not only to biodiversity, but also to ecosystem services.

            <div>
              Maquis is the stage following that of the pre-desert scrub in the ecological succession. It is usually
              characterised by small trees and large shrubs, consisting mostly of an evergreen shrub community, reaching
              a height of up to 5m, often more. It occurs along the sides of valleys, along slopes and other areas,
              which are inaccessible to man, and relatively sheltered from the wind.

            </div>
            <div>
              Mediterranean woodlands are characterised by sclerophyllous (hard-leaved, evergreen) trees with an
              undergrowth of smaller shrubs. This is the highest type of vegetation that can develop in the
              Mediterranean climatic regime, in other words, the climax of the ecological succession. This habitat type
              develops from maquis, in the absence of disturbance caused by man.
            </div>
            <div>
              In Malta, this habitat was virtually exterminated, following colonisation by man and through the grazing
              effects of introduced sheep and goats.

              <strong>Saline marshlands</strong>
            </div>
            <div>
              Saline marshlands are transitional areas that form at the interface between the marine, freshwater and
              terrestrial environments. Saline marshlands are dynamic systems and undergo annual cycles of changes in
              salinity. The salt content changes depending on rainfall, whereas in winter the saline content is low due
              to a diluting effect of the rain, in summer, the salt content is more concentrated as water levels drop.
              Salinity in the salt marsh also depends on how close this is to sea and the influx of seawater into the
              system.
            </div>
            <div>
              <em>Limbarda crithmoides, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia ramosissima, tamarisks</em>
            </div>
            <div>
              Vegetation patterns are observed in saline marshlands that reflect differences in chemical and physical
              conditions. Areas that remain dry or moist harbour those plants that are not aquatic, such as the
              smooth-leaved saltwort (Salsola soda). Shallow parts of the salt marsh that hold a small volume of water
              for several days, are colonised by plants, which although not aquatic, are still able to withstand short
              periods of inundation until the water dries up or evaporates. Deeper areas, which remain filled with water
              for longer periods, only support aquatic and semi-aquatic plants.
            </div>
            <div>
              Some coastal wetlands appear to be transitional between freshwater wetlands and saline marshlands, in the
              sense that, the biotic assemblages they support consist of species typical of both freshwater and saline
              habitats. Such wetlands have been termed ‘transitional coastal wetlands’, such as when wetlands arise when
              rainwater collects in depressions close to the sea.
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>Rainwater rock pools</strong>
            </div>
            <div>
              The movement or flow of acidified water derived from precipitation and runoff, leads to the gradual
              erosion of limestone substratum and the eventual formation of hollows or kamenitzas. The latter collect
              rainwater in winter, forming shallow freshwater rock pools, which provide a suitable habitat for a number
              of rare species. Freshwater rock pools are ephemeral, that is, last for only a short period, because in
              summer these dry up completely and may become colonised by terrestrial vegetation.
            </div>
            <div>
              Species that are specialised to this habitat type remain dormant in the soil during the dry stage, and
              emerge during the wet stage. Other species move out of the rock pool, when this is in the dry state, and
              return when conditions become favourable.
            </div>
            <div>
              The duration of how long the rock pool remains with water determines the species richness of that
              particular rock pool.

              <strong>Sand dunes</strong>
            </div>
            <div>
              Sand dunes are dynamic systems that form by a slow process of accretion, that is, the build-up of sand
              because of natural wave action. Sandy beaches are backed by dune systems, which provide an essential role
              in the stability, as well as in the defence of coastal communities. The formation of sand dunes depends on
              the sand that is carried inland by wind from the beach. Subsequently, sand is deposited and trapped upon
              encountering clumps of vegetation or some other form of obstacle.
            </div>
            <div>
              Dune vegetation is adapted to the harsh conditions present in this type of habitat. Such conditions
              include high temperatures, dryness, occasional inundation by seawater and accumulation of sand. Plant
              adaptations include extensive root systems that provide efficient anchorage in the porous and mobile
              substrate and other distinctive morphological features, such as fleshy leaves to limit water loss, and the
              presence of short white hairs to help in temperature regulation.
            </div>
            <div>
              Vegetation type changes across the dune system with distance from the beach, forming a typical zonation
              pattern.

              <strong>Valley watercourses & riparian communities</strong>
            </div>
            <div>
              Valley watercourses are one of the most species-rich habitats on a national scale. Yet, they are
              considered as one of the most endangered habitats in the Maltese Islands.
            </div>
            <div>
              In gently sloping valleys, the watercourse community is similar to that of the valley sides, whereas in
              steep-sided valleys there is a clear distinction between communities along the{' '}
              <strong>watercourse</strong> and those vegetating <strong>valley-sides</strong>. Where the terrain
              permits, the valley sides are terraced and cultivated. The construction of man-made dams in certain valley
              systems has intentionally retarded the water flow for irrigation purposes. Such dams have created new
              freshwater habitats where varieties of aquatic and semi-aquatic species thrive.
            </div>
            <div>
              The watercourse community is by nature dynamic, and its integrity depends on the amount and frequency of
              rainfall as well as other abiotic factors, such as the rate of siltation. Valleys are dry for some months
              of the year and water only flows during the wet season. However, some local valleys drain springs
              originating from the perched aquifers and retain some surface water even during the dry season.
            </div>
            <div>
              In general, the greater part of local plant and animal species reliant of water during some part of their
              life cycle are found in valley watercourses.
