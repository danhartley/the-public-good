              Olive trees have been cultivated around the Mediterranean for thousands of years, with Spain alone
              producing half of the world’s supply of olive oil, but wildfires and soaring summer temperatures mean the
              future of this ancient industry is looking increasingly uncertain.
            </div>
            <div>
              Global production is expected to fall to 2.4m tonnes according to the International Olive Council, less
              than last year’s harvest and well short of global demand of about 3m tonnes, after drought and heatwaves
              of more than 40 degrees hit production in Spain.
            </div>
            <div>
              Extreme weather in other important growing regions including Greece, Italy and Portugal as well as Turkey
              and Morocco has added to the crisis.

              Italy’s growers have also been affected by the bacterial disease nicknamed “olive ebola” – Xylella

          <blockquote>
            <div>
              The influence of regional climate change (CC) on agricultural production variance in the Mediterranean
              region has been discussed based on the assessment of the last decade. Most of the Mediterranean region has
              experienced frequent natural disasters, expanding population, increase in temperature, and increase in the
              surface of the Mediterranean Sea.
            </div>
            <div>
              Furthermore, the temperature in the Mediterranean area is rising 25% faster than the rest of the globe,
              and in the summer, it is warming 40% faster than the global average. Climate change can alter the food
              supply, restrict access to food, and degrade food quality.
            </div>
          </blockquote>

          <h4>Introduction</h4>

          <blockquote>
            <div>
              The Mediterranean is the consequence of rifting, spreading, subduction, and colliding plates and
              microplates dating back to the Mesozoic.
            </div>
            <div>
              To better understand the consequences of these changes, ecological field tests have shown that planting
              more species increases productivity and stability.
              <em> (Ed. Was there greater crop diversity in the past?)</em>
            </div>
            <div>
              Even though precipitation variability is not the only thing that matters in agriculture, it is crucial as
              60–95% of the farming land in the developing world is done so by rainfed agriculture. Statistically, it
              was found that there is a drop of 0.5% for every percentage point decrease in rainfall.
            </div>
            <div>The average annual temperature in the basin is about 1.4 °C, higher than in the late 1800s.</div>
            <div>
              Since 1950, heat waves have been happening more often, and droughts are happening more often and
              worsening.
            </div>
            <div>In the last three decades, the surface of the Mediterranean Sea has warmed by about 0.4 °C.</div>
            <div>Over the last 20 years, the sea level has risen by about 3 cm per decade.</div>
            <div>
              The Mediterranean region is expected to warm up 25% faster than the rest of the world in the future, and
              the summer will warm up 40% faster than the global average. Even if the world warms by the
              “Paris-compliant” 1.5 °C, regional daytime highs are likely to rise by 2.2 °C.
            </div>
            <div>
              A 2 °C rise in the average temperature of the atmosphere around the world will almost certainly cause a
              10–15% drop in summer rain in southern France, northwest Spain, and the Balkans, and a 30% drop in Turkey
              and Portugal.
            </div>
            <div>
              Scenarios in which Southern Europe’s temperatures rise by 2–4 °C in the 2080s would lead to a 30 per cent
              drop in precipitation (especially in the spring and summer months) and the end of the frost season in the
              Balkans.
            </div>
            <div>
              For every one degree of global warming, average rainfall will drop by about 4% in most regions, especially
              in the south. This variation will make dry spells 7% longer. Heavy rain is likely to get 10–20% stronger,
              except in the summer.
              <em>
                {' '}
                (Ed. Check these figures, esp. 1% increase temperature leads to 4% increase precipitation; seems low
                compared to other figures given here.)
              </em>
            </div>
            <div>
              <em>(Ed. Water stress esp. likely in Libya as freshwater withdrawls increase substantially.)</em>
            </div>
            <div>
              Extreme rainfall increases the likelihood of floods. This increase is partially caused by CC, which
              reveals new challenges that have little to do with weather, such as the expansion of cities and the poor
              management of stormwater.
            </div>
            <div>
              The Mediterranean countries have about 877 million ha of land, with agriculture accounting for about 28%
              of the total land area. The share of agricultural land varies significantly across the country, ranging
              from 4% in Egypt to nearly 76% in Syria.
            </div>
            <div>
              There are a lot of different farm structures, agro-management practices in the agriculture sector, and
              significant differences in environmental conditions. This means that agricultural inputs (like nutrients,
              pesticides, and irrigation water) and outputs vary a lot (e.g., crop yields). Only 8% of the agricultural
              land in the Mediterranean is irrigated <em> (Ed. uncertain as many areas not measured.)</em>.
            </div>

          <h4>Effects of Climate Change on Agriculture in the Mediterranean Region</h4>

          <blockquote>
            <div>
              The five regions (MCRs) constitute 2% of the Earth’s surface area, 20% of the world’s plant species, and
              5% of the world’s population.
            </div>
          </blockquote>

          <h5>Effects of Water</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>Drought stress significantly impacts agricultural productivity.</li>
            <li>
              Annual crops, such as cereals, are susceptible to progressive water scarcity during the blossoming and
              grain-filling phases in rainfed parts of the MCRs and semi-arid tropics, resulting in “terminal drought
              stress”.
            </li>
            <li>
              The harvest index, or the proportion of aboveground biomass allocated to grain, decreases during terminal
              drought circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>
              The quantity of water available for irrigation in most irrigated MCRs is decreasing due to recurring
              drought and intense competition for water resources among agriculture, industry, and urban areas.
            </li>
            <li>Higher temperatures increase evapotranspiration and agricultural irrigation needs.</li>
            <li>
              Water scarcity impacts the reproductive and seed/fruit development phases more than the vegetative or
              maturity stages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Water shortages throughout the blooming and fruit development periods result in a more significant decline
              in fruit yield than shortfalls towards fruit maturity.
            </li>
            <li>MCR temperatures are anticipated to climb by 2–4 °C by the mid-twenty-first century.</li>
            <li>
              High temperatures can affect various physiological and metabolic processes in plants, affecting their
              development, growth, and production. Higher temperatures related to CC have been shown to impair
              agricultural output and quality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Even mild temperature increases hasten plant growth, shortening the growing season and decreasing plant
              biomass. Consequently, changes in phenological dates will change the crop season duration and water
              requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Temperatures and evapotranspiration will rise in areas with warm spring and summer seasons (severe
              scenario, up to 4 °C). <em>(Ed. Check affects under different scenarios).</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              Warmer weather (moderate scenario, up to 2 °C) may benefit agricultural production when temperature
              restricts the duration of the growing season. <em>(Ed. Check affects under different scenarios).</em>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Sustainability and the Five Domains</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>Annual mean temperatures are currently 1.4 °C above levels from the late nineteenth century.</li>
            <li>Since 1950 heat waves and severe droughts have increased in frequency.</li>
            <li>
              Growing salinity variations may impact regional changes in river discharge along the Mediterranean
              coastlines, leading to a substantial land shift in the basin’s eastern regions. Even though Mediterranean
              circulation patterns can be altered, global sea-level rise will dominate future Mediterranean Sea-level
              change.
            </li>
            <li>
              Along the Mediterranean coast, increased CO2 absorption by the seas and acidification of 0.15 to 0.41 pH
              units are anticipated to induce significant impacts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Due to the possibility of substantial yield gains in many southern and eastern land systems, agricultural
              land management is increasing, primarily via more excellent irrigation, with ramifications for water
              resources, biodiversity, and landscape functioning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite local advancements in wastewater treatment, air and water pollution continue to grow due to
              urbanization, traffic, and other factors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Political conflicts have a substantial environmental effect, and migratory pressure continues to affect
              economies with limited resources, making it more difficult for them to adapt to environmental changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Water resources
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Most likely, the water in lakes and reservoirs will go down. Stream flow patterns are likely to
                  change, with high spring flows from melting snow ending earlier, summer low flows getting more robust,
                  and winter flows getting more significant and unpredictable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The amount of water per person in the Mediterranean, which is already very low, will drop to less than
                  500 m3 per year.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Extreme rainfall events will increase the likelihood of flooding, exacerbated by CC and non-climatic
                  variables such as increased urbanization and inadequate stormwater management systems.
                </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The diversity and long-term viability of Mediterranean land ecosystems may be most jeopardized by
                  increased aridity brought on by decreased precipitation and rising temperatures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Greater fire danger, longer fire seasons, and more catastrophic wildfires are predicted due to
                  changing climate, increased heat waves, dryness, and land use.

                <li>
                  Crop illnesses, yield reductions, and more significant production variability may all occur due to
                  extreme weather events like heat waves, cold snaps, or heavy rainfall during critical phenological
                  stages. Many winter and spring crops, particularly in the southern Mediterranean, are expected to be
                  affected by CC.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Olive production</strong> will be harmed due to rising irrigation demands due to CC. Local and
                  regional discrepancies will arise, while the influence on aggregate production is not anticipated to
                  be significant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is anticipated that the phenological cycle of <strong>grapevines</strong> would shift toward
                  shorter length and earlier blooming, accompanied by increased vulnerability to severe events and water
                  stress. These circumstances may also affect the quality of grapes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flowering and chilling accumulation are anticipated to influence <strong>fruit tree</strong> output.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reduced water, such as in <strong>tomatoes</strong>, will be the primary factor restricting crop
                  yields.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Water-saving measures might be devised to enhance crops’ quality and nutritional value while
                  maintaining appropriate output levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Due to CO2-fertilization effects, yield improvements may occur in some crops, which might boost water
                  usage efficiency and biomass output, even though the intricate interactions among the numerous
                  components and the present knowledge gaps suggest significant uncertainty. In addition, these yields
                  are anticipated to decline in quality (e.g., a fall in the protein content of cereals).
                </li>
                <li>
                  In some regions, sea-level rise and ground subsidence may severely diminish agricultural land. The
                  consequences of sea-level rise will impose more restrictions on agricultural land, notably in the Nile
                  Delta and other productive delta regions.

          <h4>Crop Yield Security in Mediterranean Region</h4>

          <blockquote>
            <div>
              Global agricultural output is increased through technological improvements, new seed and fertilizer
              variations, and improved farming techniques. Simultaneously, climatic variations, mainly the frequency of
              extreme weather events and shifting seasons, as well as regional water and energy limitations, are driving
              yield declines and weakening food security. To make matters worse, the frequency and severity of severe
              weather events have been predicted to rise due to human-caused global CC.
            </div>
          </blockquote>

          <h4>Crop Production Variation in Mediterranean Region</h4>

          <blockquote>
            <div>
              Agricultural production has a significant spatial variation in the Mediterranean region. (
              <em>Ed. Crops with variation include wheat, barley and rice</em>)
            </div>
          </blockquote>

          <h4>Climate Smart Approach</h4>

          <blockquote>
            <div>
              Climate change is expected to alter agricultural production systems globally, putting billions of people’s
              livelihoods and food security at risk. Agricultural production would be negatively impacted by rising
              temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and more frequent and severe floods and droughts. Some
              agricultural output losses might be as high as 60% due to CC, depending on the crop type, location and
              weather patterns. Nearly one-third of yield variation is attributed to CC, which might significantly
              impact agricultural production and food security. An estimated 19–29% of GHG emissions are attributed to
              the agricultural food system, which is vulnerable to global CC and the second most significant contributor
              to its causes.
            </div>
            <div>
              Agricultural management, such as sowing dates, cropping practices, and land usage must be adjusted to
              account for CC.
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <h4>Developing Framework for Climate Change Consequences</h4>

        <blockquote>
          <div>
            The Mediterranean area is anticipated to be one of the most notable and sensitive “hot zones” for CC due to
            increasing water stress concerns, desertification, erosion, and land and marine biodiversity reduction.
          </div>
          <div>
            According to the IPCC, the region is projected to warm faster than the world average and might experience a
            30–40% decrease in precipitation, particularly in the southern portion of the Mediterranean basin and
            throughout the spring and summer.
          </div>
          <div>
            Water stress and drought will worsen over the majority of the region, making it drier and decreasing the
            amount of food that can be cultivated. It is anticipated that summers in the Mediterranean will become
            substantially hotter and drier. This consequence implies that heat waves will get more intense and endure
            longer, and the risk of persistent wildfires may grow.

          <div>
            {' '}
            The rising temperatures might also facilitate the spread of illnesses such as malaria to additional areas.
          </div>
          <div>
            A rising sea level might have substantial consequences on already vulnerable areas such as the Nile Delta.

            places climate risk management and effective adaptation to the challenges of CC at the center of
            Mediterranean sustainable development.
          </div>
          <div>
            It is predicted that the Mediterranean region is warming 20% faster than the world average, putting extra
            strain on already stressed ecosystems and societies. The Mediterranean region is more susceptible to natural
            catastrophes like floods and erosion, salinization of river deltas, and aquifers, which are crucial for food
            security and the lives of those in the region.
          </div>
          <div>
            Increasing global temperatures by 2 °C would diminish precipitation by 10% to 15% by 2050, while water
            demand is anticipated to treble.
          </div>
          <div>
            In Southern Europe, a 2 °C to 4 °C increase in temperature is projected to diminish precipitation by up to
            30%.

        <h4>Significance of the Review</h4>

        <blockquote>
          <div>
            There remains a paucity of research devoted to developing and enhancing modelling capacities to increase
            agricultural output by adopting strategies that consider the sustainability of ecosystems under changing
            climatic circumstances.
          </div>
          <div>
            Increasing weather threats endanger agricultural production systems and global food security. Maintaining
            agricultural expansion while mitigating climate shocks is essential for developing a resilient food
            production system and achieving development objectives in fragile nations.
          </div>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Conclusions</h4>

        <blockquote>
          <div>
            The traditional agricultural production systems and global food security are threatened by ongoing climate
            change. Hence, maintaining agricultural growth under climate shocks is essential for establishing a
            sustainable food production system for fragile nations.
