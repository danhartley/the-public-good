          For the tenants of the building on the street of the Fallen Leaves the landlord was no more than a name on
          their lease. Rui claimed he had seen the owner. One summer afternoon he had been sitting on the step up to the
          front door when a large car - probably a Rolls Royce - had stopped outside, and the passenger window had wound
          down. An old man - who looked like a vulture - had peered out, sniffed the air, and then disappeared into the
          dark recesses of the car. In some tellings the man was the father of the current owner, in others a woman, but
          the audience remained indifferent; Rui had been a little boy at the time, full of mischief and imagination,
          and there was no one to vouch for his tale. The years passed, tenants came and went, and the building remained
          unchanged: a solid, detached block with a large, communal garden, overshadowed by a brick chimney belonging to
          the bakery next door.

          The tenants had been accustomed to paying their rent on the first Monday of each month at the offices of the
          owner’s solicitor, a firm with impressive, or at least, expensive offices on a leafy street off Avenida. The
          name written in gold over the door was Ratton and Martinho. As a junior solicitor recently put in charge of
          the property, and only a year out of law school, I was anxious to escape my desk no matter the task, so I made
          a point of calling on the firm’s clients whenever I had the opportunity.

          The house on the street of the Fallen Leaves was in a quarter I knew well from my student days, and it was my
          habit to eat lunch at one or other of the local tascas before my visit. But summer brought a change to my
          ways, and perhaps also to my tastes, and I began to eat at a little restaurant around the corner from the
          office. Whenever there was a breeze, I sat outside with my back to the hill, and my wine glass at an alarming
          tilt. And so it came about that my visit to the house on the street of the Fallen Leaves fell in step with my
          other visits, and took place at the end of the day.

          On this particular evening, I opened the heavy outer doors - the concierge had already disappeared - and
          stepped out of the shadows into the shallow light of a warm evening accompanied by the hope and expectations
          that swarm about every young man without knowing quite what they are, and with prospects that are not yet
          clear. This was the hour when people returned from work; the street was busy with pedestrians and the clanging
          of the trams could be heard up and down the main avenue. Each man carried a newspaper under his arm, or in his
          briefcase. As I passed through the park a sea of broad sheets touched and overlapped, rustling discretely
          whenever a page was turned.

          The building was filled with the smells of cooking and the banging of chairs and the slapping of bottoms.
          Mother's wiped their brows and called for quiet and father's changed out of their suits and prayed for
          silence. The Nazaré rented the third floor flat on the left. Adelaide was a chemist, Tiago a draughtsman whose
          shirt pocket was always full of sharp pencils and drawing pens, and who wore blue trousers and blue shirts at
          the weekends. Since neither of them was home during the day this was the first time we had met.
        </p>
        <p>
          I accepted their offer of a drink but first called on Rui to see about some changes he had proposed for the
          garden. By the time I returned Adelaide had already set an extra place for dinner, and invited me to join
          them. From that day I became a regular visitor; two or three nights a week I would stop by with a bottle of
          wine and after dinner the three of us would go out into the garden to talk and smoke. The youngest children
          were in bed at that hour but the older ones often stayed out till dark, pleading with their parents to let
          them go back out after dinner as the evenings grew longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three years later Adelaide and Tiago had a son, Fernão, and I was asked to be the boy's godfather. I saw
          little of the family in the first year of the boy's life and though I felt the loss of my friends' company I
          shrugged it off, convincing myself that spending more time at the office was a reflection of a new found
          diligence not a retreat into drudgery.

          It was Alfredo who recognised and then pulled me from my malaise. He had not long returned from London; though
          the experience had been liberating, the city was too cold, and too grey. He formed a collective with some
          other young men and quickly abandoned it – too male, too earnest – and was indulging a little in the nightlife
          of the city. But whatever the hour he returned home he was to be found in his studio by seven the next
          morning; and if he came straight from the street, which he did at least once a week, so be it. It was during
          this time that he began to develop the style he became known for. Many years passed before I understood why
          the paintings made such an impression on me, and before Alfredo and I discussed the reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alfredo found an agent, or rather an agent found him, and his early work - all done before he left for London
          - began to attract attention. It was at his second exhibition - the occasion on which I met Agustina Távora -
          that his new work was presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was already a large crowd when I arrived, spilling out from the tiny gallery onto the narrow, poorly lit
          street. Most of the men, including the artists, were dressed in jackets and ties and wore the type of glasses
          favoured by left wing French intellectuals. It was a group exhibition for six up-and-coming painters.
          According to a small text by the door they were confronting the challenges presented by a fractured society
          whose fault lines had been exposed by colonial imperialism. Alfredo assured me that it was drivel and that
          anyway the best artists like Paula Rego had moved to Paris or London. To me, who was both partial and
          unsophisticated, Alfredo's paintings stood out and in this the public agreed, for the number of stickers
          besides his pictures grew steadily during the evening, and far exceeded those of the rest of the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Alfredo was in demand and the wine out of reach I wandered back up the street to a little bar where I
          drank a couple of imperials and waited for the crowd to thin out. A young woman emerged from the throng and
          approached me. She asked for a light and took a couple of long puffs before offering her thanks. She held out
          her hand and introduced herself. Agustina was a journalist at one of the national papers. Her request to cover
          the war had been turned down – too young, a woman. In response she was starting a war of words back home; her
          criticism of the regime was – it was claimed - seditious and had earned her a personal rebuke from the paper's
          owner. One more mis-step would see her fired or in prison, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked home from the gallery slowly, full of the high hopes and cheerful spirits that accompany a drunken
          young man with the world before him. I delighted in the swirls of the black calçada on the Avenida da
          Liberdade and felt that anyone who had seen them both could not fail to notice the resemblance between the
          perfect white squares of calçada and the perfect white teeth of Agustina Távora.
